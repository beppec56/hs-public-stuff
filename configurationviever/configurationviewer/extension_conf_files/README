Readme for signature_component UNO component extension

License information: see file COPYING.

To build
========

You need ant (http://ant.apache.org) installed and a java compiler Java 1.5 is suggested.
Used ant 1.7.0 for testing.

You need an OpenOffice.org installed, and an optional OpenOffice.org SDK.

Edit the file build.xml in this root directory of the distribution and edit the
value of properties 'ooosdk' and 'ooo_classes_path' to suit your installation.

ooosdk is needed if you'd like to start your application with:

java -jar signature_component.jar

If the ooosdk is not present, the needed classes will not be added to the jar
package, making the line above not functional.

Localization
============

The string to be localized are in document localization-master.ods.
The button "Export messages" export the messages to "AddonMessages.xcu.xml" file.

The file path is fixed inside the macro. 
Please have a look at the macro (Main.Main() )contained in the file.

Building
========

The build.xml file in this directory is the mail ant build file.

Running it you will be able to build the entire extension.

For details see README in doc project.
